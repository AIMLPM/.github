AI/ML Product Manager working at the intersection of product, data science, and developer tooling.

I build and ship hands-on side projects using flagship LLMs, with a focus on agentic workflows, context & memory management, and developer experience.

Currently building iD8 — a multi-surface AI development environment (VS Code extension, web, and mobile) focused on reliable multi-agent orchestration, long-running memory, and governed AI-assisted software development.
